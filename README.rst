manylinux-cuda
**************

This is a fork of https://github.com/ameli/manylinux-cuda.

The fork modifies the manylinux script to include the full CUDA due to the Rust `cust` crate requiring libcuda.so.
Since the original repository is BSD-3-Clause license, this fork retains the same license. 

We are keen to discuss with @ameli into having this be part of https://github.com/ameli/manylinux-cuda, if the attempt appears successful.
